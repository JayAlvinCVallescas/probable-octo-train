  <h2>Calle Crisologo Vigan</h2>
  <p>
    The city known for its Calle Crisologo tour has succeeded in maintaining the traditional area where calesas may still be found (horse-drawn carriages). One of the numerous things to see and do in Vigan is to try the well-known and delectable Ilocos empanada and stroll down cobblestone lanes dotted with gift shops offering pottery and Abel Iloko textiles.

  <h2>Nacpan Beach Beach El Nido</h2>
  <p>
    El Nido in Palawan is most known for its picturesque islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute land journey from its main town will take you to Nacpan Beach, another dreamy location.
    The El Nido Big Lagoon and other premier Palawan beaches should not be overlooked during island-hopping adventures. But a trip to the tranquil Nacpan Beach is highly recommended and merits a space on your agenda of things to see and do in El Nido after a busy day of seeing coves, white-sand beaches in El Nido, limestone cliffs, and other El Nido Palawan tourist attractions.

  <h2>Intramuros and Fort Santiago</h2>
  <p>
    Take a journey down memory lane in Manila's walled Intramuros, one of the country's most famous sites. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi built this 64-hectare Spanish fortification, which was destroyed before the conclusion of World War II.
    However, the ruins are still very much in use today and are among the best Manila locations for Instagram. Both Intramuros excursions and a Manila bike tour are options for exploring the area. Numerous institutions and universities have moved into the neighborhood. This neighborhood is ideal for a Philippines vacation because it is home to numerous historical sites, including the stately Manila Cathedral and San Agustin Church, the country's oldest church and a hallmark in Philippine architecture.

  <h2>Taal Volcano</h2>
  <p>
    Locals and foreign tourists from Manila frequently travel south to Tagaytay, a tranquil town well-known for its temperate climate, breathtaking scenery, and several tourist attractions that are well-known for being one of the greatest family-friendly locations close to Manila.
    The Taal Volcano, one of the smallest active volcanoes in the world and a stunning landmark in the Philippines, is visible from the best Tagaytay hotels. On an island within a lake within an island, the volcano is located.

  <h2>Kawasan Falls Cebu</h2>
  <p>
    Kawasan Falls in Cebu is ideal if you enjoy wading into or swimming in soothing flowing waters. It is a multi-layered waterfall in the town of Badian, and its turquoise waters are what make it so popular.
    The first cascade, or level, has a height of 40 meters and is where most guests rest, swim, and take a bamboo raft ride for a free natural water massage. It takes ten minutes to get to the second cascade, which is quieter.
